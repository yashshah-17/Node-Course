# node-course

I am doing a NodeJS course from Udemy named "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)". This repository is specifically dedicated to the application material of this course.

It consists of 4 applications, namely Notes-app, Weather-app, Task Manager, and Chat-app. I will be making my own modifications to these applications and this repository will hold all those modified applications.
